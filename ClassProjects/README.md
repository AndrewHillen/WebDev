These are some canned projects from a web development class I took.

As of the time of this writing, they are all up and accessible via

lab3a.andrewhillen.com

lab3b.andrewhillen.com

lab4.andrewhillen.com

lab5.andrewhillen.com

As regular class assignments, they don't do much, or solve any particular problem. I have them here mainly to showcase some familiarity with various technologies (Vue, MongoDB, etc.)
